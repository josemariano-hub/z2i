Technical animation showing a helistat complete flight mission sequence: (1) The vehicle sits on the ground, four toroidal envelopes deflated and compact. (2) Time-lapse inflation - helium flows in, envelopes expand into full donut shapes. (3) Rotors spin up with visible thrust vectoring. (4) Smooth vertical takeoff showing combined buoyancy and rotor lift. (5) Forward flight at 80 km/h with visible airflow streamlines around the envelopes. (6) Precision hover while lowering cargo. (7) Smooth descent and landing. (8) Deflation sequence. Clean white background, technical blueprint aesthetic with floating specifications text. Photorealistic with technical overlay graphics.
```

Silent, low-altitude flight across desert terrain following a winding valley. The vehicle maintains stable hover 100 meters altitude while an IR sensor pod beneath slowly pans across a distant ridge. Split-screen shows real-time thermal imagery from the sensor alongside the helistat's position. After 4 hours on station, it returns to base at dawn. Military tactical overlay graphics, call-outs showing "4 HR ENDURANCE", "SILENT OPS", "32 KG SENSOR PAYLOAD". Gritty, realistic military cinematography style. Desaturated color grading.

Slow-motion shot of the four enormous toroidal envelopes (each 8.9m radius) glinting in sunlight as the vehicle maneuvers precisely between buildings. The helistat positions itself over the construction site and gently lowers a shipping container (11 tons) onto steel beams 40 stories up. Construction workers in hard hats guide it into place. Wide shot shows the helistat is much quieter than a traditional helicopter crane - workers below can talk normally. Cost comparison overlay: "$1,000/delivery vs $7,200 (helicopter)". Bright, saturated commercial cinematography.
