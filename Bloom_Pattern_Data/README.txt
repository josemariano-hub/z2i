This data is the supplementary material of the paper "Bloom Patterns: Radially Expansive, Developable, and Flat-Foldable Origami" by Zhongyuan (Kelvin) Wang , Robert J. Lang, and Larry L. Howell.

We present bloom patterns as a family of radially expansive, flat-foldable, and developable origami patterns, many of which are rotationally symmetric. Bloom patterns are defined with a generalized definition and a standardized definition. A classification scheme for bloom patterns is identified, and several types of bloom patterns are analysed. The distinct helical nature that characterizes bloom patterns is described, and a set of compatibility conditions is derived to help determine if a valid bloom pattern can be constructed based on the standardized definition. At last, applications of bloom patterns are discussed. 

Images of crease pattern diagrams, digital models, and paper prototypes of bloom patterns are used throughout the paper to explain and demonstrate the content. A catalog of bloom patterns further demonstrates the diversity and characteristics of bloom patterns. This includes the abovementioned image types as well as video clips of the folding process of paper prototypes and simulated models. Furthermore, a computer program is written to generate the crease pattern of Yoshimura bloom patterns based on the corresponding mathematical model in the paper. The catalog and the computer program constitute this supplementary material.
