## ⚠️ Trade-offs & Limitations

### Where Helistats LOSE:
- **Speed:** 1/2 to 1/3 of helicopters (80-109 km/h vs 170-296 km/h)
- **Range:** Slower speed limits distance (90-323 km vs 400-800 km)
- **Wind:** Limited to 25 kts operational (vs 35+ kts helicopters)
- **Footprint:** 3-5× larger area for ground handling
- **Altitude:** Envelope stress limits ceiling (3,000-4,500m vs 5,500-7,000m)

### Sweet Spot: "Heavy, Slow, and Economical"
Perfect when **cost matters more than speed:**
- Construction site supply (daily 2-ton deliveries)
- Mining camp logistics (sustained operations)
- Long-duration surveillance (4-12 hour persistent ISR)
- Base perimeter security (24/7 coverage)
- Disaster relief (sustained cargo delivery)
