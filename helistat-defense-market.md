## Defense Certification Pathway

### Military Airworthiness vs FAA Certification

**Key Advantage:** Military can deploy novel aircraft under "military airworthiness" without FAA approval.

| Aspect | Military Airworthiness | FAA Certification |
|--------|----------------------|------------------|
| **Authority** | Service-specific (Army, Navy, etc.) | FAA Part 27/29 |
| **Timeline** | 1-2 years | 5-7 years |
| **Cost** | $2-5M | $20-50M |
| **Requirements** | Mission-specific, risk-based | Universal safety standards |
| **Precedent** | None needed (novel OK) | Requires similar type |
| **Flight Testing** | Military test ranges | Civil airspace restrictions |
| **Risk Tolerance** | Higher (trained personnel) | Very low (public safety) |

**Strategy: "Military First, Civil Second"**

### Phase 1: Military Airworthiness (Years 1-3)
1. Partner with military service (Army ideal)
2. Obtain military airworthiness certificate
3. Deploy to training/testing environments
4. Accumulate 500-1,000 flight hours
5. Demonstrate reliability metrics

**Flight Hour Accumulation Plan:**

| Mission Type | Hours/Year | Number of Vehicles | Total Hours/Year |
|--------------|------------|-------------------|------------------|
| ISR Training | 200 hrs | 5 vehicles | 1,000 hrs |
| FOB Resupply (test) | 150 hrs | 3 vehicles | 450 hrs |
| Base Perimeter | 300 hrs | 2 vehicles | 600 hrs |
| **TOTAL** | - | **10 vehicles** | **2,050 hrs/year** |

**Timeline:**
- Year 1-2: Build 10 vehicles, obtain military airworthiness
- Year 2-3: Deploy to training bases, accumulate 4,000+ flight hours
- Year 3: Use flight data for FAA certification application

### Phase 2: Civil Certification (Years 3-5)
1. Submit FAA certification application
2. Include 4,000+ military flight hours as safety data
3. Demonstrate no catastrophic failures
4. Show operational reliability >95%
5. Obtain Part 27 (or Special Class) certificate

**Precedent:** Multiple military aircraft transitioned to civil (Bell 206, MD500, etc.)

**FAA Will Ask:**
- Flight hours? **CHECK: 4,000+ from military ops**
- Safety record? **CHECK: Demonstrated in military service**
- Similar type? **No, but military validation de-risks**
- Failure modes? **CHECK: Buoyancy fail-safe proven**
